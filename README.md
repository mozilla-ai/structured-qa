This specialized fork demonstrates how to use open-source models and a simple LLM workflow to analyze academic papers and research documents. Key features include:

- 📚 Optimized for academic paper analysis
- 🔍 Intelligent section parsing and navigation
- 📊 Preservation of mathematical notation and citations
- 🎯 Focused on technical precision and academic rigor
- 🤖 Using Qwen 7B model for improved comprehension

A lightweight, open-source solution for answering questions about structured documents using simple LLM workflows, designed as an efficient alternative to complex RAG systems.

## Quick-start

Get started with academic paper analysis using one of these options:

| Google Colab | HuggingFace Spaces  | GitHub Codespaces |
| -------------| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| [![Try on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mozilla-ai/structured-qa/blob/main/demo/notebook.ipynb) | [![Try on Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Try%20on-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mozilla-ai/structured-qa) | [![Try on Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=904169776&skip_quickstart=true&machine=standardLinux32gb) |

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexmeckes/academic-paper-structured-qa.git
cd academic-paper-structured-qa
pip install -e .
```

2. Launch the academic paper analysis UI:
```bash
python -m streamlit run demo/app.py
```

### Command Line Usage

Install from pip:
```bash
pip install structured-qa
```

Analyze a paper:
```bash
structured-qa \
--question "What were the key findings of this study?" \
--input_file "path/to/your/paper.pdf" \
--output_dir "output/directory"
```

## Key Differences from Original Blueprint

This fork differs from the original Structured-QA Blueprint in several ways:
- Uses the more powerful Qwen 7B model for better academic comprehension
- UI optimized for academic paper analysis
- Enhanced section parsing for research paper structure
- Better handling of technical content and mathematical notation
