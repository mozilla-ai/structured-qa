as regards the implementation of this Regulation, including through the collection of relevant data and information for
the purpose of fulfilling their tasks on the Board.

majority. The rules of procedure shall, in particular, lay down procedures for the selection process, the duration of the
mandate of, and specifications of the tasks of, the Chair, detailed arrangements for voting, and the organisation of the
Board’s activities and those of its sub-groups.
6. The Board shall establish two standing sub-groups to provide a platform for cooperation and exchange among market

issues. Where appropriate, representatives of the advisory forum referred to in Article 67 may be invited to such sub-groups
or to specific meetings of those subgroups as observers.

tasks of the Board pursuant to this Regulation and its rules of procedure.
