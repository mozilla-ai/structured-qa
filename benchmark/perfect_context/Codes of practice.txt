(a) the means to ensure that the information referred to in Article 53(1), points (a) and (b), is kept up to date in light of
market and technological developments;
(b) the adequate level of detail for the summary about the content used for training;
(c) the identification of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, including their sources, where appropriate;
(d) the measures, procedures and modalities for the assessment and management of the systemic risks at Union level,
including the documentation thereof, which shall be proportionate to the risks, take into consideration their severity
and probability and take into account the specific challenges of tackling those risks in light of the possible ways in
which such risks may emerge and materialise along the AI value chain.
3. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models, as well as relevant national competent
authorities, to participate in the drawing-up of codes of practice. Civil society organisations, industry, academia and other
relevant stakeholders, such as downstream providers and independent experts, may support the process.
4. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice clearly set out their specific objectives and
contain commitments or measures, including key performance indicators as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of
those objectives, and that they take due account of the needs and interests of all interested parties, including affected
persons, at Union level.
5. The AI Office shall aim to ensure that participants to the codes of practice report regularly to the AI Office on the
implementation of the commitments and the measures taken and their outcomes, including as measured against the key
performance indicators as appropriate. Key performance indicators and reporting commitments shall reflect differences in
size and capacity between various participants.
6. The AI Office and the Board shall regularly monitor and evaluate the achievement of the objectives of the codes of
practice by the participants and their contribution to the proper application of this Regulation. The AI Office and the Board
shall assess whether the codes of practice cover the obligations provided for in Articles 53 and 55, and shall regularly
monitor and evaluate the achievement of their objectives. They shall publish their assessment of the adequacy of the codes
of practice.
The Commission may, by way of an implementing act, approve a code of practice and give it a general validity within the
Union. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 98(2).
7. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models to adhere to the codes of practice. For providers
of general-purpose AI models not presenting systemic risks this adherence may be limited to the obligations provided for in
Article 53, unless they declare explicitly their interest to join the full code.
8. The AI Office shall, as appropriate, also encourage and facilitate the review and adaptation of the codes of practice, in
particular in light of emerging standards. The AI Office shall assist in the assessment of available standards.
9. Codes of practice shall be ready at the latest by 2 May 2025. The AI Office shall take the necessary steps, including
inviting providers pursuant to paragraph 7.
If, by 2 August 2025, a code of practice cannot be finalised, or if the AI Office deems it is not adequate following its
assessment under paragraph 6 of this Article, the Commission may provide, by means of implementing acts, common rules
for the implementation of the obligations provided for in Articles 53 and 55, including the issues set out in paragraph 2 of
this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article
98(2).
